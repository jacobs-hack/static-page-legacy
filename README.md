# jacobshack-splash
This is the jacobsHack! Splash Page.

Atribution
----------

This project is based on the HackMIT landing page.
`https://github.com/techx/hackmit-splash`

The `master` branch will be deployed at https://2016.jacobshack.com once it's ready.


Testing
-------

To view the splash page on your own computer, simply run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in this directory. Then, go to `http://localhost:8000` to view your version.

Dev
---

Make sure to compile your scss appropriately. Something like `sass --watch stylesheets/scss:stylesheets` suffices.
