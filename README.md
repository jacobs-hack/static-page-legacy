`https://github.com/techx/hackmit-splash`

The `master` branch is deployed at https://2016.jacobshack.com.


Testing
-------

To view the splash page on your own computer, simply run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in this directory. Then, go to `http://localhost:8000` to view your version.

Make sure to compile your scss appropriately. Something like `sass --watch stylesheets/scss:stylesheets` suffices.
