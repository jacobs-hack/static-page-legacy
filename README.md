# jacobshack-splash
This is the jacobsHack! Splash Page.

Atribution
----------

This project is based on the HackMIT landing page.
`https://github.com/techx/hackmit-splash`


Since this Github pages, the public-facing branch is `gh-pages`. Therefore, `gh-pages` is a sacred branch, do not commit there unless you are 100% certain it is deploy-ready.


Testing
-------

To view the splash page on your own computer, simply run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in this directory. Then, go to `http://localhost:8000` to view your version.

Dev
---

Make sure to compile your scss appropriately. Something like `sass --watch /some/path/hackmit-splash/stylesheets/scss:/some/path/hackmit-splash/stylesheets` suffices.
